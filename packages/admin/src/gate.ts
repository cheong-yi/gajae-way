 * to make the bot speak in a channel or rewrite monitors by accident.
 *
 * `evaluate()` is deliberately unchanged: allowlist, actor, `confirm ===
 * operationId`, audit-before-dispatch. The console layers a *stronger*
 * requirement on top for destructive operations (typing the target object's
 * name, per the allowlist's `confirmToken`); it never relaxes what is here.
